DataStax Brisk
==============

This package contains a HDFS compatable layer (CassandraFS) and a CassandraJobConf
which can be used to run MR jobs without HDFS or dedicated job/task trackers

To try it out run:

1. compile and download all dependencies
   
    ant

2. start cassandra with built in job/task trackers

    ./bin/brisk cassandra -t -f 

3. view jobtracker
   
    http://localhost:50030

4. examine CassandraFS

    ./bin/brisk hadoop fs -lsr cassandra:///
